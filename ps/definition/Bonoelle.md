it's a special case from [[Uniform distribution]] but it only have length of 2.

If we have only 2 posibilities, and we know the posibility of one,
$X=\{0,\,1\}$

we can conclude the other by
$P(x=1) = 1-P(x=0)$

$P(x=0) = k$


In this case it's easier to calculate E(x)
just by:
$E(x) = k$ or $E(x) = P(x=0)$

also with V(x) just by:
$V(x) = k\times(1-k)$ or $V(x) = P(x=0)\times P(x=1)$
