## Introduction

There are tree types of handling tasks:

- ### Sequential:
Where tasks get handled by 1 process, one by one it finishes the tasks

- ### pseudosequential:
finishes tasks just like sequential, but partially for each one, so it will finish just part from task 1,2 and 3. then it rents and repeat.

- ### Parallel:
the tasks get handled by 2 processes, every 2 (usually)


### Note:
The changing get controlled by the Synconizer that controlls the Processor's timer




## execution mutuelle
when 2 processes have the same task at the same time, they can make mistake of resolving it twice which is problematic

so this is the solution of blocking one of them, because the other one wont have the neccesary tools to finish the task
