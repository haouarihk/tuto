# Mare Solution:

It's the best solution
it could be the fastest or most optimal
Also it could be the direct solution, with no turn arounds or unecessary over complexifing it.


## how do we find it:


### In Algorthmics
we use  TIme complexity and Space complexity to compare solutions and get the **optimal** one
