## To convert into a standard form from a normal form
we need to add a variable in each equation, (ex: x_4, x_5, x_6), 
we also get the N and the M
which are
N: total number of variables
M: total number of equations


## To get [[SBR]] in a normal form:
easiest way is to set every variable to be zero, except the ones that only occure in each equation

example: 
max Z = 5x_{1} + 4x_{2} + 3x_{3}


we need to convert to a standard form




in the form of $(x_{1},\,x_{2},\,x_{3},\,x_{4},x_{5},x_{6})$ = (0,0,0,15,11,8) 

$x_{1},\,x_{2},\,x_{3}$: are [[VHB]]
\,x_{4},x_{5},x_{6} are [[VB]]

we start with Z = 0, based on the first equation




- convert from normal to standard
- calculate [[SBR]] it will tigger [[Pivotage]]
