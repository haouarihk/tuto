teach us, How does the user analyzes the forms


- group things that are related together, and that are differet somewhere farther
space between them and the things that are related is crucial, and needs to be different

- human always tend to group things that are similar together, and be the same group, it could be the figure, color, and even the size.

- [[utilisability]]


## equations

### for buttons
$$
	T = a+b\times\log_R(\frac{D}{W}+1)
$$
**T**: Time it takes
**a,b**: constants
**D**: distant from the mouse to that item
**W**: size of the item(or button)

#### examples for a good design
- google search with their pages implementation, where they don't show every page number, just < **1** 2 3 ... 49 > 


## for radio buttons, or selectors
$$
 T = K\times\log_R(n+1)
$$
**T**: Time it takes
**k**: constant
**n**: number of choices.
