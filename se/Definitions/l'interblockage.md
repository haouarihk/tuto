# Interblockage:

In concurrent computing, deadlock is any situation in whichÂ no member of some group of entities can proceed because each waits for another member, including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or, more commonly, releasing a lock.


A way to achive it, is with using [[SEMAPHORE]].
