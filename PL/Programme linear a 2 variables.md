- ## Problem de production

### un fabricant produit 2 types yaounts a la frase A et B surnat letablur

|               | A   | B   |     |
| ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| fruite        | 2   | 1   | 800 |
| sugar         | 1   | 2   | 700 |
| lemon         | 0   | 1   | 300 |
| selling price | 4   | 5   |     |

- how much can we make from each product, using the resources we have
A(max) = 800/2 =  400;
B(max) = 300/1 = 300;

- how much profit can we get from each product, if we produce only one of them

Profit of A = 4x400 = 1600
Profit of B= 5x300 = 1500


## steps to find the model
- find the variables (x-> quantity A,y->quantity B)
- find what we are aiming for (Zmax, max profit)
Zmax = 4x + 5y
- find the limitations
	- 2x + 1y <= 800
	- 1x + 2y <= 700
	- 0x + 1y <= 300
	- x,y >= 0



## Note: 
- it's always Zmax or Zmin
