## Introduction

There are tree types of handling tasks:

- ### Sequential:
Where tasks get handled by 1 process, one by one it finishes the tasks

- ### pseudosequential:
finishes tasks just like sequential, but partially for each one, so it will finish just part from task 1,2 and 3. then it rents and repeat.

- ### Parallel:
the tasks get handled by 2 processes, every 2 (usually)


### Note:
The changing get controlled by the Synconizer that controlls the Processor's timer
