# Probability And statistics:
also known as "Probabilitie et statistiques"




## Rappoles sur les statistics mathematics:

### ensombles: enum or a collection of items
**ex:** A = {1 , 2, 3}.


### exercise shape:
- get the enum's items from it's equation (A = {k in R; k = n; n in N}) sometimes, from one euqaiton result to another.




## sous-ensembles:
it's the result ensembles's operations:

#### intersection: An(opposite of U)B
x in A and x in B

#### dunim: AUB
x in A or x in B

#### complemontare(C_{a} b): {x in a and not in b}
a: the bigger circle
b in the excluded part of a
the result is the what's left

## probability:
## A- get all at once (no returns)
possibilty that item get chosen

P**a** = (Favorability of getting n of a) / (Favorability of getting n items from the sack)

p = C_B^A

- **B** is the total
- **A** is an amount form B
- **p** is the favorable of getting n items from a


##### example:
sack of 3 blue balls, 2 red balls
what is the probability of getting 2 balls from the sack that are blue from the sack

1- calculate the total probability
Pt = C_5^2
2- calcualte the probability
Pa = C_3^2 / Pt;


### Disjoint:
meaning that A and B have nothing in common(joint)


**Partitition:**
meaning that A and B make a full C


## EquiProbability (Equal probability)

if probablity for each one equals the otheres
P(Ei) = P(Ej)
P(Ei) + ... + P(Ej) = 1


## Notes:

- $P(E) = P(E\cap F) + P(E\cap F')$$
- $P(B\cap A') = P(B) - P(A)$
