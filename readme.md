# What is this?
This is a collection of lessons i learned on my univercity year(thrid year L), with some webdev added bonus.

It is a bit messy with french-english words, because i need them to search for the source.

It uses obsidian.

## Why is it here?
I just wanted to organise this year's lessons. and also make my webdev sheetsheat

I'm making it public so that people who are in the same boat as me, can benefit from it
