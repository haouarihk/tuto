Goes with the equation of
$$
E(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x\cdot f(x)\,\,dx
$$


## How do we start with the proof:
- after getting the [[Density]] equation.

- We do the same thing we did with [[Density]]'s proof but instead of proving its equal to 1, it will be proving it equal to Y.


Therefore we will only need to prove that 
$$\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}} f(x)\,\, dx = Y$$
Y depends on the distribution funciton.
