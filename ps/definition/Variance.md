Goes with the equation of
$$
V(x) = E(x^{2}) - E^{2}(x)
$$



## How do we start with the proof:
- after getting the [[Density]] and [[Spovence]] equations.

- We do the same thing we did with [[Density]]'s proof but instead of proving it equal to 1, we prove for $E(x^{2})$.


Therefore we will only need to prove that 
$$\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}} f(x)\,\, dx = Y$$
Y depends on the distribution funciton.
